/// (represented by `B: BlockSet`) on disk. Obviously, the length of user data
/// must be smaller than that of the block set.
///
/// # On-disk format
///
/// The on-disk format of `CryptoBlob` is shown below.
///
/// ```
/// ┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
/// │VersionId│   MAC   │  Length │       Encrypted Payload      │
/// │  (8B)   │  (16B)  │   (8B)  │        (Length bytes)        │

///
/// # Security
///
/// To ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data, `CryptoBlob`
/// takes several meansures:
///
/// 1. Each instance of `CryptoBlob` is associated with a randomly-generated,
/// unique encryption key.
/// 2. Each instance of `CryptoBlob` maintains a version ID, which is
/// automatically incremented by one upon each write.
/// 3. The user data written to a `CryptoBlob` is protected with authenticated
/// encryption before being persiting to the disk.
/// The encryption takes the current version ID as the IV and generates a MAC
/// as the output.
/// 4. To read user data from a `CryptoBlob`, it first decrypts
/// the untrusted on-disk data with the encryption key associated with this object
/// and validating its integrity. Optimally, the user can check the version ID
/// of the decrypted user data and see if the version ID is up-to-date.
