/// A cryptographically-protected log of user data blocks.
/// 
/// `CryptoLog<L>`, which is backed by an untrusted block log (`L`),
/// serves as a secure log file that supports random reads and append-only 
/// writes of data blocks. `CryptoLog<L>` encrypts the data blocks and 
/// protects them with a Merkle Hash Tree (MHT), which itself is also encrypted.
/// 
/// # Security
/// 
/// Each instance of `CryptoLog<L>` is assigned a randomly-generated root key
/// upon its creation. The root key is used to encrypt the root MHT block only.
/// Each new version of the root MHT block is encrypted with the same key, but
/// different random IVs. This arrangement ensures the confidentiality of
/// the root block.
/// 
/// After flushing a `CryptoLog<L>`, a new root MHT (as well as other MHT nodes)
/// shall be appended to the backend block log (`L`).
/// The metadata of the root MHT, including its position, encryption
/// key, IV, and MAC, must be kept by the user of `CryptoLog<L>` so that
/// he or she can use the metadata to re-open the `CryptoLog`.
/// The information contained in the metadata is sufficient to verify the 
/// integrity and freshness of the root MHT node, and thus the whole `CryptoLog`.
/// 
/// Other MHT nodes as well as data nodes are encrypted with randomly-generated,
/// unique keys. Their metadata, including its position, encryption key, IV, and
/// MAC, are kept securely in their parent MHT nodes, which are also encrypted.
/// Thus, the confidentiality and integrity of non-root nodes are protected.
/// 
/// # Performance
/// 
/// Thanks to its append-only nature, `CryptoLog<L>` avoids MHT's high 
/// performance overheads under the workload of random writes 
/// due to "cascades of updates".
/// 
/// Behind the scene, `CryptoLog<L>` keeps a cache for nodes so that frequently 
/// or lately accessed nodes can be found in the cache, avoiding the I/O 
/// and decryption cost incurred when re-reading these nodes.
/// The cache is also used for buffering new data so that multiple writes to 
/// individual nodes can be merged into a large write to the underlying block log.
/// Therefore, `CryptoLog<L>` is efficient for both reads and writes.
/// 
/// # Disk space
/// 
/// One consequence of using an append-only block log (`L`) as the backend is 
/// that `CryptoLog<L>` cannot do in-place updates to existing MHT nodes.
/// This means the new version of MHT nodes are appended to the underlying block
/// log and the invalid blocks occupied by old versions are not reclaimed.
/// 
/// But lucky for us, this block reclaimation problem is not an issue in pratice.
/// This is because a `CryptoLog<L>` is created for one of the following two
/// use cases.
/// 
/// 1. Write-once-then-read-many. In this use case, all the content of a 
/// `CryptoLog` is written in a single run. 
/// Writing in a single run won't trigger any updates to MHT nodes and thus
/// no waste of disk space.
/// After the writing is done, the `CryptoLog` becomes read-only.
/// 
/// 2. Write-many-then-read-once. In this use case, the content of a 
/// `CryptoLog` may be written in many runs. But the number of `CryptoLog`
/// under such workloads is limited and their lengths are also limited.
/// So the disk space wasted by such `CryptoLog` is bounded.
/// And after such `CryptoLog`s are done writing, they will be read once and
/// then discarded.
